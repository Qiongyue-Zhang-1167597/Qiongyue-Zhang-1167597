# Set the "secret key" that our app will use to sign session cookies. This can
# be anything.

# Anyone with access to this key can pretend to be signed in as any user. In a
# real-world project, you wouldn't store this key in your source code. To learn
# about how to manage "secrets" like this in production code, check out

# For the purpose of your assignments, you DON'T need to use any of those more
# advanced and secure methods: it's fine to store your secret key in your
# source code like we do here.
